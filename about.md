My name is Diana Falkowska and I’m a cheerful, 22 year old girl from central Poland.

I speak Polish, English and Italian, but we can have a small chit-chat in French and Swedish as well. (Spanish and German in progress :).

I’m also a front-end developer at Wikia company. Basically, I should have started with this sentence, as the blog will not be about me, but rather about the front-end development, self development and IT in general. Maybe with a little dose of abstraction, as I prefer to describe and explain things rather than say ‘if you want to know, you can read the source code’.

Blog was inspired mostly by my colleagues and the book [Apprenticeship Patterns](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000001813/index.html) which I strongly suggest each new adept of programming craft to read.
