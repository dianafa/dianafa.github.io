* Funny narrow cars - I guess they are meant to fit in small parking slots and narrow streets, and I’m partially right, see: [Kei cars on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kei_car)

* Left-side traffic

* [Pedestrian scrambles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedestrian_scramble) - in some crowded places zebra crossings are placed not only horizontally to the pedestrian area, but they cross and overlap each other as well. That means, that once pedestrians see the green light they can cross  an intersection in every direction, including diagonally. At the same time, all vehicular traffic is stopped.

* If you are an average-height person, you’ll be probably taller than most of the Japanese people. Good  - thanks to this you’ll be able to breathe in a subway train and find a way in various crowded places. Bad news - some of the subway or JR stations were not constructed with tall people in mind - watch out for low ceilings and small doors.
I don't have many photos with me and some Japanese people to illustrate the issue, but even in this pic the difference is visible (see below).

* Manga, manga, manga everywhere. On the buildings, streets, billboards. One of the JR trains we rode was pasted all over with huge Digimon stickers. That’s actually really cool. It reminded me not to take life too seriously. Moreover, it makes Japanese streets really colorful and charming.

* The Japanese don’t tend to eat/drink on the go.

* Vending machines are on every street, every corner, they occupy every free space. The most popular ones are those with soft drinks and snacks, but you can find them supplied with hot beverages, hot soups, umbrellas or museum tickets.

* Taxis (cabs) - all of them look more or less the same (see pic below). Taxi drivers wear special suits (kind of uniforms) and white gloves and they look really elegant. Usually cabs have also a self-opening doors, not to bother clients with touching them.

* Japanese people don’t speak/ speak very little english. Even in such places like bank/currency exchange on the international airport or Starbucks, where most of the foreigners come. There are several reasons for that:

    * lessons are conducted in traditional lecture mode - there’s one teacher who speaks and the rest is listening. Do I have to explain why it has no chance to work?

    * they usually have only 1h of english lessons per one or even two weeks! They are taught tons of english grammar and words, but program doesn’t (przewiduje) examples of how to actually use them - no dialogs, sample songs, books, movies, cartoons are used. So, they usually know what to say, but are simply not able to do it, because they do not know how.

    * another reason has cultural background: in Japan in general people are encouraged not to speak. Kids are taught both physical as well as verbal discipline. All improper or redundant actions or words can be heavily punished by teachers or parents.  As a result, for the whole life, any Japanese person wants to do anything considered stupid or crazy, like saying something in foreign language or do it incorrectly.

    * last, but not the least of the reasons I’ll describe here (I’m sure there’s more) is that Japanese people doesn’t really care about the english. They REALLY don’t think it’s usefull at all. Japanese society is one of the most linguistically and culturally homogeneous countries on the world, composed of 98.5% ethnic Japanese. On the streets, in shops, public transport on TV - everywhere the Japanese language is spoken. Because of that, they tend to treat learning this language as a some kind of hobby or whim rather than a thing that becomes more and more crucial, especially in the world of internet.


* Nobody talks in subway. The only talking people are sometimes foreigners (jap. _gajin_). Every japanese person is or sleeping (70%) or playing with her mobile phone. While watching video, please note how silent is there - only because nobody speaks! (the only speaking person is actually my companion, sorry for that :P).

* Maybe you noticed this strange melody on the video above. It wasn't of course mobile ringtone (they are prohibited in public transport as well). It was a jingle! On most of the Japanese metro/train stations you'll have a chance to hear a special, customized sound alarms for the opening and closing of the door. No more boring 'beep' sound. The drawback is, that after one week we were quite tired of them. It also surprises me, that on the one hand they seriously take care about silence and calmness in public transport, but on the other hand this jingles and information alerts wrapped with *arigatou gozaimasu* are very loud and annoying. More info about japanese train station jingles [here](http://supermerlion.com/japanese-train-station-jingles/).

* On the streets of Tokyo there are no public trash cans. For me it’s quite annoying- many times I was forced to walk for half a day with bag filled with empty bottles, paper cups or food wrappers before I finally was able to empty it. I’ve asked my fellow Japanese about the reason. He said when he was young (about 20 years ago) he remember the bins were on the streets. However, after the [terroristic attack in 1995](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_subway_sarin_attack) where 19 people died, Japanese got very sensitive about stuff left in stations or on the streets. That’s why trash cans were removed. Although it was a risk that city will soon become very dirty, Tokio citizens got used to carrying their trash around until they can toss it. Moreover, lack fo public rubbish bins helps the municipal government save money on maintenance. Besides, as mentioned before, Japanese don’t eat/drink on the street so they don’t produce so many rubbish like other cultures.

* Although there’s no trash cans on the streets, Japan generally is a very clean country. Streets, sidewalks, parks, public toilettes, subway stations are as clean as they only could be. It’s mainly because Japanese just don’t tend to litter. They are taught to clean up things around them in their houses and in primary school, for example by assigning them to cleaning classroom, main hall or toilets for 30min everyday. Besides, they are very community - minded. Apart from having a street-cleaning service, a common practice is to meet in group of people Sunday morning, wear some neon-yellow bands and with pick-up sticks clean the streets of their neighbourhood.

* Public toilets can be found almost everywhere. They are very clean, modern and for free. And full of electronic stuff.
